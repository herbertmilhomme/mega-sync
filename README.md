mega-sync
===================

Python Sync Application for mega.co.nz

THIS IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT. 

This Python script will _eventually_ be able to keep a local folder in 'sync'
with mega.co.nz.

Included is the following extra classes to assist us and you might find useful
for your own application:
    * bucket.py - helps us with our local sqlite3 database
    * mega_thing.py - helps us easily deal with mega objects returned from Mega
    * mega_sync.py - a work in progress; our sync application.
